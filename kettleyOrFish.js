/**
 * 🌧️🌞 Hello Weather Lovers (or haters)! 🌞🌧️
 *
 * Welcome to the wonderful world of weather! Your task is to write a function called `kettleyOrFish`.
 * 
 * John Kettley is a famous British weatherman known for predicting rain (🌧️), and Michael Fish is known for
 * getting it wrong sometimes (🌤️). Depending on the forecast, you need to decide if you're more of a Kettley (expecting rain)
 * or a Fish (expecting sunshine)... or simply Confused
 *
 * Here's the deal:
 *  - Only if the temperature is below 15°C and the forecast mentions "rain", you're feeling more like John Kettley. Return "Kettley".
 *  - Only if the temperature is above and equal to 15°C and the forecast mentions "sunshine", you're channeling your inner Michael Fish. Return "Fish".
 *  - If it's any other weather state, irrespective of the temperature, you're a bit confused, so just return "Confused".
 *  - If the temperature and weather conditions go against the Kettley and Fish rules, surely you're "Confused", e.g. "rain" and 15°C or above.
 * 
 * Examples:
 *    kettleyOrFish(10, "rain") ➞ "Kettley"
 *    kettleyOrFish(20, "sunshine") ➞ "Fish"
 *    kettleyOrFish(15, "cloudy") ➞ "Confused"
 *    kettleyOrFish(25, "rain") ➞ "Confused" 
 *
 * Your implementation should handle temperatures between -30°C and 50°C and common weather descriptions like "rain", "sunshine", "cloudy", etc.
